# Traffic_Sign_Classification
In this project, we will use Convolutional Neural Network to build train and test a traffic sign classification model. We will build this model using tensorflow and keras. It is a multiclass classification problem. This model can be used to make smarter cars.We started with downloading the dataset, preprocessing it, created the model and found out the predictions using the model. During preprocessing we found that this dataset has 43 classes. Model reached an accuracy of 95%+ in just 50 epochs, we can further optimize the model using hyper parameter tuning and reach a higher accuracy.This model can be used in self driving cars which will enable them to automatically recognize traffic signs similarly the driver alert system inside cars will help and protect drivers by understanding the traffic signs around them. THE STEP :
1. FINDING DATA ON KAGGLE AND LOADING IT INTO COLAB.
2. PREPROCESSING THE IMAGES AND VISUALIZING THEM.
3. FINDING OUT THE MEAN OF THE DIMENSIONS AND RESIZING ALL IMAGES ACCORDINGLY.
4. CONVERTING THE IMAGES INTO A NUMPY ARRAY AND NORMALIZE THEM.
5. CHECKING CLASS IMBALANCE
6. SPLITTING THE DATA AND PERFORMING ONE-HOT ENCODING.
7. CREATING THE MODEL ARCHITECTURE, COMPILING THE MODEL AND THEN FITTING IT.
8. PLOTTING THE ACCURACY AND LOSS AGAINST EACH EPOCH.
9. PREPROCESSING THE TEST DATA AND MAKE PREDICTIONS ON IT.
10. VISUALIZING THE ORIGINAL AND PREDICTED LABELS FOR THE TEST IMAGES.
